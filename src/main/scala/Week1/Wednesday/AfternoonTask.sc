//The 'Double' type is most appropriate here as you're dealing with decimals.

//Extension
//1
//The order of logical operators in IF statements in descending order is: NOT (!), AND (&&), OR(||).

//2
//(true || false && false) would result in false && false being evaluated first, because the order of precedence demands it. This would resolve to simplify the expression to true || false.

//3
//((true || false) && false) would result in the true || false part being evaluated first. This would evaluate to true because at least one of these would be true.

//4
// (1 < 4 && 7!= 10*| 9 + 10 == 21) would result in true.
